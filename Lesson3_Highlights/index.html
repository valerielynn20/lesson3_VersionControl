            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a system that allows you to recall files or set of files that have recorded changes able to be revisited at later times. This is very useful for graphic or web designers because it allows the user to go back and revisit every version of an image. The user can compare changes or revert the entire project back to a previous state. There are three types of version control. There is Distributed Version Control Systems, Centralized Version Control Systems, and Local Version Control Systems. All this help with storage of backup data in case any server dies, the user can restore it.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git and VCSs are not the same thing. The difference with Git and any other VCS is the understanding of the data the two software’s have. Previous information was stored as a list of file-based changes. Git thinks of data more along the lines as a stream of snapshots. When you save your work in Git it saves the data as a picture of what your files look like at that exact moment. Git mostly only needs local files and resources to operate until VCSs that also use distributed and centralized. Actions are added to the Git database to make it difficult to lose any data.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Each time your project comes to a place which you would like to record you will have to make changes into your repository. There are two states that your working directory can be in. These states are called tracked or untracked. Tracked files are files can be unmodified, modified or staged from the last snapshot. Everything else from your working directory that was not in the latest snapshot and are not in your staging area is Untracked files. Using the git status command allows you to determine which files are in which state. Using git add you can track a new file.

            <p class="lead">
A Git project can be done using two main approaches. Git allows you to either take or clone. Taking an existing project allows you to just import it into Git. Cloning allows an existing Git repository to be recreated from another server. To initialize a repository in an existing directory you need to go through the project’s directory. This will be named .git and will contain all of your necessary repository files and will appear in a new subdirectory. The git clone command is used if you want to make a copy of an existing Git repository. This helps if your server disk gets corrupted.

                <span class="text-muted">Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are several basic commands for git. The following are all specific git commands, git commit, git branch, git checkout, git checkout –b, git reset, git revert, git merge, git rebase, git fetch, git pull, and git push. Each of these are ways to easily use the program. For example, git branch name allows you to create a new branch and name it. They can also be deleted using more of the basic commands like git branch –d name. Or using git merge will create a new commit with two parents. This combines all the work that has been done in both branches.
